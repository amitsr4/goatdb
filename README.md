GoatDB is the world's first database built like a distributed version control system. Think git, but for your app's data, that synchronizes in realtime and resolves merges automatically.

GoatDB powers Ovvio's realtime collaboration system (https://ovvio.io) in production since January 2024. This project is an effort to separate the underlying DB and offer it as an open source technology for the community to enjoy.

# Status

We're working hard on getting ready for a v0.1 launch. We expect it to happen in Q1 2025.
